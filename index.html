  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Debasmita Banerjee, a Ph.D. student in Optics and Photonics at the College of Optics and Photonics, CREOL, University of Central Florida. My work primarily revolves around understanding light-matter interactions, particularly in the nonlinear optics regime, and I employ various techniques in integrated photonics.

  <p>
    When I'm not in the lab, I can often be found daydreaming, creating artwork with digital or mixed media, or enthusiastically explaining STEM topics to kids. I believe that a curious mind can illuminate the world more than any laser.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this website, you'll find insights into my research and a peek into my life outside the lab. Enjoy your visit!
